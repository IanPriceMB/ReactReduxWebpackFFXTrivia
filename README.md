# ReactReduxWebpackFFXTrivia

This is the final mix of my Final Fantasy Trivia project culminating in everything I know about front end code
There will be a back end added on later to include save functionality for users.
This project uses React, Redux, Webpack, React Hooks/Classes, as well as the Adobe Creative Suite including Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro
I own none of the music/video content.
This is a fan made project for Final Fantasy X
